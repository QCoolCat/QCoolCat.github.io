I am a third year undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://spe.sysu.edu.cn), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn). My research interests are cosmology and gravity, inflation, cosmological perturbations, CMB anisotropies and related topics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chengcheng Han](https://spe.sysu.edu.cn/node/3303) from School of Physics, Sun Yat-sen University.
