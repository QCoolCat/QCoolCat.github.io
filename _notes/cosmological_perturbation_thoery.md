This is the note I wrote when I was studying cosmological perturbation thoery.

The note is mainly based on the perturbation part of Daniel Baumann’s textbook Cosmology and Viatcheslav Mukhanov’s textbook Physical Foundation of Cosmology. [Download the note here!](https://qcoolcat.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)
